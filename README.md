## Installation

1. Download the latest version from GitHub Releases
2. Extract the zip folder to a new directory
3. Run symbols/setup.exe as administrator, alternatively build the keyboard then install.

## Building

You need Windows 7 or earlier, 100% display scaling and Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4 installed in order to build this. You cannot use Windows 8 or later, any display scaling will break the program. You can use a Windows 7 virtual machine to compile.

## Bug fixes

* All diacritics moved to AltGr, meaning you can now use ` in source games to open the console.

## Bugs

* Problem with Breve/Inverted Breve and Alphanumeric Circles, both removed until I can fix the problem.
