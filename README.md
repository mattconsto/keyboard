## Installation

1. Download the latest version from GitHub Releases
2. Extract the zip folder to a new directory
3. Run symbols/setup.exe as administrator, alternatively build the keyboard then install.

## Building

You need luck and Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4 installed in order to build this. It's not a very reliable bit of software.
